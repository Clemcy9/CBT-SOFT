what is the major difference between django and drf

## Genie

Django and Django REST Framework (DRF) are both frameworks for building web applications in Python, but they have different focuses and purposes. The major difference between Django and DRF lies in their intended use cases and the features they provide.

Django is a high-level web framework that is designed for building full-featured web applications. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and provides an extensive set of tools and features for database management, URL routing, template rendering, user authentication, and more. Django is often used for developing complex and data-driven websites.

On the other hand, DRF is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs using Django. It is built on top of Django and extends its functionality to provide a streamlined development experience for creating RESTful APIs. DRF provides features such as serialization, authentication, permissions, viewsets, and routers, which make it easy to build API endpoints and handle common HTTP operations like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

In summary, while Django is a general-purpose web development framework, DRF is specifically focused on building APIs using Django. If you are looking to build a web application with complex functionality, Django would be a good choice. However, if your main goal is to develop a RESTful API, then DRF would be the preferred option as it provides additional tools and conventions specifically tailored for building APIs.
